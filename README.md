# Basic Research, Applied Research and Growth

**Abstract.** It is by now widely recognized that research and development (R\&D) spending  is a fundamental driver of economic growth. Recent theoretical work has suggested that the kind of R\&D spending ought to matter [(Akcigit, 2021)](https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/88/1/1/5922649) with a particular focus on the distinction between basic and applied research. What are the returns on these two types of research? How can estimates of these returns help us think about the appropriate allocation of R\&D spending between basic and applied research? To answer these questions we leverage county level data on the universe of contractual agreements by the United States (US) Federal Government from 2001 to 2023. Using national R\&D spending as an instrument for local spending, we estimate that the spending multiplier on basic R\&D is around two, whereas applied research has a multiplier around one. Basic research also generates more new patenting activity, raising total patents by around 5\% for a 1\% increase in spending relative to GDP- roughly double the increase due to applied R\&D spending
